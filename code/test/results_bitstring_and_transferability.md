**Results** after running qaoa_test.py

Task 1.
More frequent bitstrings:
['10011', '01100', '10011', '01100', '01100', '01100', '01100', '01100']

As notice, from a certain layer on, the solution is the same for the maxcut problem of the particular selected graph.

Task 2.
**Number of layers: 8**
Solution for the optimized graph with 6 nodes: 011011;

Solution for the same graph but using the optimized params taken from a graph number 1: 011101.


**Number of layers: 12**
Solution for the optimized graph with 6 nodes: 011011;

Solution for the same graph but using the optimized params taken from a graph number 1: 110100.
